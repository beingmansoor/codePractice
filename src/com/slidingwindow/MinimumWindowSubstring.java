/*
 * Solution #
This problem follows the Sliding Window pattern and has a lot of similarities with Permutation
in a String with one difference. In this problem, we need to find a substring having all
characters of the pattern which means that the required substring can have some additional 
characters and doesn?t need to be a permutation of the pattern. Here is how we will manage
these differences:

1) We will keep a running count of every matching instance of a character.
2) Whenever we have matched all the characters, we will try to shrink the window 
	from the beginning,keeping track of the smallest substring that has all the matching 
	characters.
3)We will stop the shrinking process as soon as we remove a matched character from the sliding
  window.  One thing to note here is that we could have redundant matching characters, e.g.,
   we might have two ?a? in the sliding window when we only need one ?a?. 
   In that case, when we encounter the first ?a?, we will simply shrink the window without
    decrementing the matched count. We will decrement the matched count when the second ?a? goes
     out of the window.
