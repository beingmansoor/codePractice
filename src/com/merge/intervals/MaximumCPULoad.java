/*
 * Maximum CPU Load (hard) #
We are given a list of Jobs. Each job has a Start time, an End time, and a CPU load when
 it is running. Our goal is to find the maximum CPU load at any time if all the jobs are 
 running on the same machine.

Example 1:

Jobs: [[1,4,3], [2,5,4], [7,9,6]]
Output: 7
Explanation: Since [1,4,3] and [2,5,4] overlap, their maximum CPU load (3+4=7) will be when
 both the jobs are running at the same time i.e., during the time interval (2,4).
Example 2:

Jobs: [[6,7,10], [2,4,11], [8,12,15]]
Output: 15
Explanation: None of the jobs overlap, therefore we will take the maximum load of any 
job which is 15.
Example 3:

Jobs: [[1,4,2], [2,4,1], [3,6,5]]
Output: 8
Explanation: Maximum CPU load will be 8 as all jobs overlap during the time interval [3,4].

 Solution #
The problem follows the Merge Intervals pattern and can easily be converted to Minimum 
Meeting Rooms. Similar to ?Minimum Meeting Rooms? where we were trying to find the maximum 
number of meetings happening at any time, for ?Maximum CPU Load? we need to find the maximum 
number of jobs running at any time. We will need to keep a running count of the maximum CPU load
at any time to find the overall maximum load.
